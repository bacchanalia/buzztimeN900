buzztime.py
On the Nokia N900 this program will use the phones vibe function
to represent the time within a 5 minute interval.
You can set the camera button to initiate buzztime using shortcutd.
Useful if you feel silly taking out your phone to check the time constantly. 

Time is buzzed out as hours followed by minutes.
Both hours and minutes are a sequence of three vibes.
There are three kinds of vibe, which correspond to the numbers 0 - 2
0 - A long slow vibe        (____)
1 - A shorter fast vibe     (---)
2 - Two short fast vibes    (- -)
For hours:
    The first vibe changes every 6 hours between 0 and 1
    The second vibe changes every 2 hours between 0, 1, and 2
    The third vibe changes every 1 hours between 0 and 1
    In summary the hour can be calculated as:
        First * 6 + Second * 2 + Third
For minutes:
    The first vibe changes every 30 min between 0 and 1
    The second vibe changes every 10 min between 0, 1, and 2
    The third vibe changes every 5 min between 0 and 1
    In summary the minutes can be calculated as:
        First * 30 + Second * 10 + Third * 5

Examples:
    00:00   ____  ____  ____    ____  ____  ____
    11:55   ---  ---  ---    ---  ---  ---
    05:35   ____  - -  ---    ---  ____  ---
